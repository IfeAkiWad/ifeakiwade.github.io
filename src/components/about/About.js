                Like many, I first came in to contact with code on Myspace in 2008. My curiosity and desire to spruce up my profile, lead me to interacting with HTML and CSS. Of course, then, I didn't know I was "coding", or even knew I was tampering with HTML. I just understood that I needed to tweak around these characters to get a result. Looking back, I remember being fascinated by being able to manipulate the webpage. I felt like a hacker extraordinaire!<br /><br />Fast forward to 2020, I was met  with the inspiration to hop on to a different path. Who would have thought, I would be reaching back to that brief experience on Myspace to rekindle a fascination.<br /><br />Now I am a Flatiron School graduate! I have a background in customer service and psychology. I graduated from California Baptist University with a Bachelor's of Arts in Psychology before making my transition into Software engineering. I am currently available for an entry-level/junior frontend developer role, or apprenticeship.</p>
